1.Appwrite and twillo for SMS Messaging.
2.Sentry for tracing of activity on the app.
Project 1 : A healthcare management system where patients can create accounts and book appointments with doctors of a hospital.An admin dashboard is involved that allows an admin schedule or cancel notifications after which a patient gets an SMS message of the details.
The frontend is built with Next.js and the backend with appwrite for authentication and databases.
Future scope of the project is to add a payment page and email verification or an email printout of all the user's details provided.
3.netstat -aon | findstr :3000
This code shows the process running on port 3000
4.taskkill /PID 12345 /F
Change the PID values with the values on the far right after running the command above.
5.npm run dev -- -p 3001(Next.js project)
To run code from vscode on port 3001
6.Rank of CPUs is Intel Pentium,Intel Core i3(2 cores),Intel Core i5(4 cores) and Intel Core i7(2-8 cores).
7.To buy CPU,check
(a)CPU
(b)Memory
(c)Generation
(d)Clock Speed(Highest id 2.5GHz)
8.MERN STACK-This makes a full stack developer hence frontend and backend.This is for web developement.Express works inside Node.js
(a)Mongodb--NoSql Database
(Authentication and Data storage)
(b)Express--For backend API to interact with frontend
(c)React-Frontend(a framework or library of javascript)
Routing to show different web pages
(d)Node.js--For backend API to interact with frontend
Hence React for user interaction,Express and Node.js to call API for request handling and MongodB to hold user details.Hence node.js builds the server-side application and Express is a node.js framework that runs on this serever side application.
9.Stack is a collection three technologies  that  is frontend,backend and database.Hence MERN stack is even distributed in these.
10.VPN use is encouraged when connecting to a public network.A cyber attack occurs when your machine is sending data or money over a public network and an individual intercepts that network to steal your details(eg password).VPN secures the transaction by creating a terminal where no one sees the transaction.
VPN disguise your whereabout and give you access to restricted content.Hence VPN allows your machine to a server on another country and access data.
VPN Client on machine-ISP-VPN Tunnel-Internet
VPNs don't track the sites you visit.VPNs decrypts your data.Hence advantages is anonymity and acess to firewall blocked content.
9.A proxy server is an intermediate server to which people can connect to get access to geo-blocked content.The proxy server gives a new IP address to the client and hides yours*.
VPNs are thought to be more secure and with less downtime compared to Proxt Server because VPNs encrypt the user's details however handlers of Proxy Sever can access the IP address of a user.
Proxies are faster because of less intricaies involved.
Proxy server keeps track of the sites being visited.A company can configure Proxy Server such that some sites cannot be visited.
Media like twitter and amazon make sure every device is resticted to only one account however proxies can be used to bypass this.
10.A landing page is a destination page made for specific audience with a specific goal.Features include:
(a)Navigational menus are removed.
(b)Call-to-action buttons are on top or bottom of a page.The button is reflective of what will happen next say Sign Up or Register.
11.GitHub Tips
(a)Be unique on your profile
(b)Recruiters check if you're constantly updating
(c)Write a readme that describes goal of the project
(d)Deploy projects and leave the link in the ReadMe.
(e)Contribute to projects
         README TIPS
(a)Give a description of the project
(b)Outcome......the goals of the project
(c)Stack......List all the technologies that is frameworks and libraries used.
Explain what each technology does.
(d)Vision.....what are some future things you want to add to the project.
(e)Stage.....what is done and what is pending or whether you've completed the project.

*How to run and install dependencies if they want to run this project locally.
*At About: This is the code repository of the " " project.In this project,we build and
deploy a " ".Covered topics include:........
Add tags to the about
12.Next.js is an extension of React.Hence React is the base.
Hence,knowing JavaScript to do React.
SSR....Server-side Rendering.
In react,most tasks are handled on the client-side however Next.js allows for SSR to lift burden off the browser.
Hence SSR allows users with slow internet to view content more quickly.
Hence,Next.js can handle frontend and backend.
React was created by Facebook.In react,hooks are used to :
(a)Manage States
(b)Manage Effects
(c)Manage browser events
Server Components:
(a)Fetch data
(b)Access backend resources
(c)Keep sensitive information on the server
(d)Reduce load on client-side
Forms are:
(a)Interactive
(b)Handle Events
(c)Send data to dB
'use client'...........denotes a client component
SEO implies Search Engines understand your  websites better and can recommend it to more
users.
Hence,Next.js gives better SEO and an improved user experience(faster page load and less waiting time).
Next.js allows gives better security.
When pushing to github is giving errors : git remote set-url origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git

6.git push -u origin (branch_name)
Others:
(a)git branch (give a name).....This creates a branch
(b)git branch.......To check the branch name
(c)git checkout (name given).....This does a switch to the initially created branch.
You can create changes on one branch and changes on another.Thus by switching between the branches,you can easily
retract changes.
(d)git merge (second branch)....Say you have an initial branch called master.You can merge the master and footer branch
by moving to the master branch and doing a git merge footer to have the footer now onto the master.
(e)git pull.......Checks if everything is up to date.Hence do a git pull after a git merge.

                      SEO.......Search Engine Optimization
-Websites are advised to use good SEO techniques.This allows websites get high rankings in google.
-The process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic.
Better SEO ensures visitors get to your website almost always.
                     TYPES
(a)Off-Page SEO......This is not controlled by a developer but by factors such as
Niche or location of the website and quality content of website in respect to users requests.
(b)On-Page SEO.......This is implemented by the developer
              REQUIREMENTS OF GOOD SEO(On-Page SEO)
(a)Title tag
(b)Description(holds title we see when  a search is done)
Descriptions must be unique,less than 150 words containing the essential keywords.
This is held in the meta tag specifically the content section.
(c)Url must be easy to understand and tell what the page is about.Usually below
115 characters.The shorter a url,the better.
(d)Other meta tags
 -viewport:This gives instructions on control of the page's dimensions and scaling.
 -charset: This gives the language set being used that is English or whatever
 -author : This shows the author of the page.
CMS--Content Management System
(e)Favicon.......This is an icon that seeks to improve user experience.
It is on the side of the url.
(f)Images........Large images ensure a slow image
Eg is compressJPEG.com
 <img  src="nat.PNG"  width="50%"> 
The width property ensures that a developer can determine how large an image is.
alt property in the img  helps image be associated with the content of a website.
Hence a description of the image.It will appear as a tooltip in most browsers.
(g)Mobile friendliness of a website
(h)Minify and compress the website to ensure faster download speed.
Manually,remove spaces  to achieve this.
A website does this.
(code . )..............This is a command that opens VSCode from whenever you are.
