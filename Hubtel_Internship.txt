                             HUBTEL INTERNSHIP NOTES
1.In-app Notifications
Notifications inside an app e.g like in LinkedIn.This helps users not forget important
information.
*Push notifications dives users back into an app.Example are notifications on top of your screen
that when you tap you get into an app.
--There are notifiction servers(Apple or Google) between sender and receiver.
--Notifications are sent by tokens.
--When you send a message from your phone,the notification server gives your device a token.
The token represents the application of that device.Thus each device has different tokens for that application
hence making it easy to transfer notifications between apps on devices.
--Companies use push notifications to alarm staff of a meeting.(Broadcast info to everyone).
SNS...........Simple Notifications Service.
--Push notications are not so necessary but helpful.
--Push notifications are used for:
(a)Chat or messaging apps
(b)Alarms for services

2.(A)Web Socket is a protocol that enables two way communication between client and server.
API is a one way communication protocol.It allows for persistent communication.
Data is transferred as JSON format.It uses handshake.
Typical use case of web sockets is in betting apps where updates are constantly being
received from a server.Online gaming and chat applications use Web Sockets.Connection exists continuously 
unless terminated.Communication is via events and messages.
Another is Stock Trading Websites where updates are constantly sent from the 
backend to the frontend.For Games,web sockets ensure UI is constantly refreshed
as a match goes on.

OTHERS:
(a)Http is one way(either client sends and server waits or vice versa) and TCP is two way
that is both van send.Http is stateless.Hence,web sockets works on TCP.
Web Sockets are faster because they are two-way.
**Polling is the process by which a client makes a request for data from server.
Polling is done at intervals.Polling causes alot of connection to be established
of which many contain empty responses.Alternative is HTTP Long Polling which causes 
data to pushed to client constantly from server whenever data is available.
Web Sockets is full duplex.Hence,server is constantly checking database for latest data.

--socket.io is a javascript library for easy implementation of web sockets.
--Web Sockets are not supported in older browsers.
--Whatsapp uses web sockets.
**High Level implies a general overview.
**Sending message to a friend is POST.GET is used to receive the message.

Http(REST) is easier to setup.
MAJOR COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS
1.Short Polling is the process by which client is constantly requesting for data
from server where it receives an empty request or data(JSON).Within few seconds,
a call for data is made again.There's continous use of resources here.
2.Long Polling is similar to short polling however in event that there is no data
after a request,the server keeps the connection for which if data arrives,it is
forwarded to the client.
3.Web Sockets ensures a bidirectional constant connection.Eg is data to multiple
clients on a system is good implementation of web sockets.
SSE....Server Sent Events(Unidirectional flow)
Data is constantly sent from the server.This is stateful.Eg is Live Stream where
a video is being sent directly to our devices.
UPI.....Unified Payment Interface.
TCP is in the transport layer.
Stateless implies that after data transer,connection is automatically lost.
AJAX...Asynchronous Javascript And Xml
Hence,we say an AJAX request.
4.Polling
