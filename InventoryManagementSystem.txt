*CRUD operations and track activity of all users.Policies include user,manager and administrator.
*User is the shop OR smaller shops used to request or order items from warehouse which we are creating.
*Warehouse delivers the items.
User can make a request or cancel the order.
*Records will be available for admin to see what is going on.
*Much as a user can request or cancel an order,so can and admin do so and even edit an 
order.
*When an order is made,there must be real-time communication between a client(shops) and an admin(warehouse),
this is done using SignalR.
