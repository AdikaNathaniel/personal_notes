             DimensionS
1.Zeroth Dimension:Just a single point.
2.First Dimension:A straight line
3.Second Dimension:A shape of length and breadth.Eg 2D games like Super mario and Street Fighter or a paper.
4.Third Dimension:A space of length,width and height.Eg Humans
5.Fourth Dimension:A combination of space and time.Eg is video games
6.Three.js is a javascript framework for making 3D graphics for web development on top of WebGL.
7.Renderer takes the 3D Scene,the environment,the objects and lightning and processes everything to 
be viewed on a 2D screen.
(a)Scene.........This defines the space where everything happens
(b)Camera........This determines the perspective of the scene
(c)Objects.......These are shapes to populate the scene
           TYPES OF 3D OBJECTS
(a)Mesh
A combination of geometry and material.Eg a cube is made by a box geometry and material.
(b)Points
A collection of small dots in space
(c)Line
A connection of dots in space
(d)Group
A collection of multiple objects
(e)Sprite
An object that always faces the camera.
All these stem the javascript class of Object3D.
            PROPERTIES OF 3D OBJECTS
(a)Position
Location of an object in the 3D world.Described as x(left or right),y(top and down) and z(front and back).
(b)Rotation
The spinning of objects in a 3D space.
(c)Scale
How big or small an object is
             MORE NOTES
(a)Geometry is the shape of an object.It's properties are Vertices,Edges and Faces.
-Vertex.......Corner points in a 3D space(point in space defined by x,y and z)
-Edge..........Combines vertices
