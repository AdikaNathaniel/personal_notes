 The difference between C#  And .NET
1.C# is a programming language whereas .Net is a framework for building different applications using languages of F# and C#.
(Like Django for Python)
(Like Spring,Hibernate and Springboot for Java)
(Like Laravel for PHP)
2.".NET" consists of a class library and a Common Language Runtime(does a conversion to machine instructions that your device can understand).
3.C# came in 2001 to combine C++ and Visual Basic advantages.
4.C# supports procedural and object oriented programming.
5.C# is a statically typed language meaning the type of variables is defined at compile time.(Hence,compiled language).
Dynamically typed languages is at Runtime(Hence,interpretated language).Eg is python.
6.C# is supported by Microsoft.
.NET 8 was released in 2023.
For 3D games,Unity is used.
For machine learning,python is used.
Console applications interact with a user via the console or terminal.
7.C# is used for web applications,cloud applications,desktop applications,games,AI-powered languages and mobile
applications and Windows Services.
Applications of C# are developed on .NET.
.Net 6 is cross platform in that applications created with it can run on Windows,Linux
and Mac.
Aside C#,dotnet supports F# and Visual Basic.
C# is grouped into C# 10 and C# 11 working togethere with .Net6 and .Net7.
C# is the general name however,C# 10 and .Net 6 were released in 2021 with # 11 and .Net 7 releaed in 2022.
Hence,C# 10 sought to improve the simplicity of code with ,C# 11 making further improvements to C# 10. 
8.C# however is the main language for .Net development.
C# is type-safe meaning that on compilation,the compiler checks that all data types are
properly used otherwise,an error will be flaged.
9.C# is familiar to C,C++,Java and JS.
10.C# 1.0..............2002
C# 1.1..............2003
C# 2.0..............2005
C# 3.0..............2007
C# 4.0..............2010
C# 5.0..............2012
C# 6.0..............2015
C# 7.0..............2017
C# 8.0..............2019
C# 9.0..............2020
C# 10.0..............2021
Compiling C# 1.0 today,it'll still compile.
Visual Studio 2022 won't work on Linux but Vscode will.
Visual Studio 2022(Community,Professional and Enterprise Edition) is the flagship IDE.
*Intellisense
*IntelliQuote..........Other quotation that comes up when you type one.
                                            PROGRAMMING NOTES
1.Strings work with " ".
2.Build is checking for errors in  the application hence compiling it without running it.
3.Console.WriteLine("Please Enter Your Name");
string name = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine("Hello " +name);
4.The generated files are:
(a)Project
(b)Solution................A grouping of all available projects
(c)Executable file
*The sln file contains references that a project contains.
5.To manually run this console app,
-Open Project folder
-Open  Bin->Debug->net8.0 folders
-Type "cmd" in the address bar
-Type the ".exe" say "AdikaPractice.exe"
6.Debugging is investigating code for errors hence identifying breakpoints. 
When a breakpoint is reached,debugger comes in allow a dev to check for errors.
7.Compilation happens before execution.
8.A breakpoint can be introduced in code via Visual Studio where at that particulat breakpoint,
only the code above the breakpoint runs.
-Click continue to get the application running as normal.
*Use the "step over" to get code to run line by line after introducing a breakpoint.
SDK consists of CLI and libraries.
9.Creating A CSharp application for console,
-dotnet new console -n "First Program"........Create a new console app with name "First Program"
Others:
-dotnet build................This is to compile an application
-dotnet run
For a CLI app,dotnet run will do however for a web app,dotnet watch will do.
10.Using C# Dev Kit which was intended to give Visual Studio experience in VsCode,
-Ctrl + Shift + P for the Command Palette
-.NET Project
-Console App
-Give a name and select a location
-Create Project
Beneath is a Solution Explorer from which program.cs and  other project files can be obtained.
Right Click on the folder app name you gave to build the project.
11.CSharp Documentation on Microsoft Docs is a good way to learn C#.
12.C# Statements:
(a)Always end with semi-colon like:
Console.WriteLine("Hello");
(b)Whitespaces do not matter. 
13.Identifiers like name
(a)Identifiers must start with a letter or an underscore.It can't start with a number.
14.Comments are given as "//" or "/*  */".......Single-line and Multi-line comments
15.C# Keywords:
(a)int         
(b)in
(c)class
(d)using
(e)while
(f)new
(g)null
(h)if
(g)else
(i)case
(j)ref
(h)return
(k)lock
(l)long
(m)string
(n)struct
(i)enum
(j)const.........for immutable values
const decimal age = 0.07;
(h)void
16.Variables can be integer,string or dates.
-int age;..........type and identifier
age = 25;
Console.WriteLine(age):
-CamelCase is usually used like firstName
17.string lastName = Console.ReadLine();
This is to take user input.
18.C# is a strongly typed language in that every variable must have a type.
19.DataTypes in C# are:
(a)Predefined Types
-bool
-int(int32 for 4 bytes)
-float
-double
-decimal
-char
-byte............Takes values between 0 and 255
-short
-object
-string 
(b)User-defined Types
Data Types ensure type safety in that:
int c = 3;
c= true;............This will lead the code to break.
int months = 12, bonus =100;............Notice both are of the same type.
byte numberOfEmployees = 124;
string(" ") is a collection of char(' ').
string nat = string.Empty; IS SAME AS  string nat = " ";
20.C# Operators:
-Arithmetic Operators
int month =3;
month = month +1;
month +=1;
-Equality Operators
-Logical Operators
-Assignment Operators
21.Default values are false for bool and 0 for int.
int nait = int.MaxValue;
int nati = int.MinValue;

char myChar = 'a';
bool isWhiteSpace = char.IsWhiteSpace(myChar);
bool isDigit = char.IsDigit(myChar);
bool isPunctuation = char.IsDigit(myChar);

char userSelection = 'a';
char upperVersion = char.ToUpper(userSelection);

bool isDigit  = char.IsDigit(userSelection);
bool isLetter  = char.IsLetter(userSelection);
22.DateTime and TimeSpan are  used for Date And Time.

DateTime employeeStart = new DateTime(2023,03,12);
Console.WriteLine(employeeStart);
DateTime  today = DateTime.Today;
Console.WriteLine(today);

DayOfWeek day = someDateTime.DayOfWeek;
Console.WriteLine(day);
DayOfWeek twoDaysLater = someDateTime.AddDays(2);
Console.WriteLine(twoDaysLater);
bool isDST = someDateTime.IsDaylightSavingTime();
Console.WriteLine(isDST);
                                //Year,Month,Day,Hours,Minutes,Seconds
*DateTime employeeStart = new DateTime(2023,03,12,14,30,0);
Output is : 3/12/2023 2:30:00 PM


DateTime exitDate = new DateTime(2025,02,9);
Console.WriteLine(exitDate);
2/9/2025 12:00:00 AM

DateTime exitDates =  exitDate.AddDays(1);
Console.WriteLine(exitDates);
2/10/2025 12:00:00 AM

DateTime currentDate =  DateTime.Now;
Console.WriteLine(currentDate);
This gives the immediate Date and Time.

bool areIn =  currentDate.IsDaylightSavingTime();
Console.WriteLine(areIn);
This gives whether or not it is day or not.

Console.WriteLine(startHour.ToLongDateString());
*Wednesday, October 9, 2024
Console.WriteLine(endHour.ToShortTimeString());
*3:53 AM

Changing Between Types
(a)Implicit Conversion
int a =123456789
long l = a;
//A smaller data type fitting into a larger datatype.
//A long cannot be put in an int.This is where explicit casting comes in. 
(b)Explicit Conversion....Casting
double d = 123456789.980;
int a = (int) d;
(c)Helpers
Implicit Typing is causing the compiler to determine the data type on it's own.
Eg 
  var a = 123;
  var b = true;
  var c = 11.0;
C# looks at the values on the right and decides the type.
For developers,this makes code less readable.
Explicit Typing involves using the exact datatype.
int a = 123;
bool b = true;
double d = 11.0;
23.C# is a strongly typed language.
24.Decisions consist of "if" or "switch" and Iterations consist of  "while","for".
25.Relational Operators are:
(a) ==
(b) !=
(c) > or <
(d) >= or <=
26.Logical Operators:
- &&
- ||
27.
int age = 23;
bool a = age == 23;
Console.WriteLine( "Age is 23" +a);
//This gives true.

int age = 23;
bool b = age > 23;
Console.WriteLine( "Age is 23" +a);
//This gives false.
28.
bool  c = (age >= 18) &&  (age <= 65);
Console.WriteLine("Age is between 18 and 65" +c);
Result is true.
29.
if(condition).................This always works with a condition.
else if(condition)
{
}
else
{
}
